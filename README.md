# ParticleTypography
Using rune.js and p5.js to draw webfonts with particles


# Roadmap / Ideas:
- Different colour particles
- Solidly filled letters - still with the repulsion on mouseover. Remove particles and distort the letter polygon itelf.


- Slight particle movement when mouse is still.
- Using something like: https://p5js.org/examples/math-noise-wave.html
  * Can the noise be a realtime param? To take musical note/freq instead of random noise?
  * Amplitude + frequency effect level of particle distortion
